            <h4>(Co founder and chief executive of Alan)</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>“They have some great similarities in the way the market is built, but also some great difficulties,” says Samuelian. “It’s going to force us to learn new things, adapt to the market, adapt to local systems, connect to the healthcare providers. Can we build a company that is multi-local with a single platform?”
<br><br>
                “If we manage to do that well in three countries, we are going to be very aggressive in terms of international growth.” </h4>

            <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">What problem are you trying to solve?</h2>
            <h4>Back at the office, a clear sense of purpose also runs through the organisation itself. 
<br><br>
                Samuelian and his cofounder, Charles Gorintin “spent a lot of time” and “put a lot of thought” into how Alan would run in the early days. (This isn’t Samuelian’s first company, and it shows.) 
    <br><br>            
                “You need to be very articulate about your business model and the problems you’re trying to solve. And you need to be very articulate about how you’re going to solve them,” he says. 
<br><br>                
                All that thinking led the team to four core values: fearless ambition, distributed ownership, radical transparency, and personal and community growth. 
 <br><br>               
                They’re not just buzz words, though, he insists; they influence how the whole organisation runs — and how it treats its people.</h4>

        <div>
            <h3>“You need to attract the best people in the world, if you want to solve the biggest problems,” says Samuelian — and the best people like (fearlessly) ambitious goals, being their own boss, knowing why decisions are being made and continuous learning. </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Distributed ownership</h2>
            <h4>“One of my ownerships as CEO is to set a strategic plan for the next 12 months. But the way it works is that I’m going to ask, ‘What do you think we should have solved in one year’s time?’ And then people will contribute, then I will do my own version and I will share a first draft. All steps are public, accessible and everybody can challenge them.”</h4>
            
            <h4>This digital process helps people feel involved, but not overwhelmed, says Samuelian. It’s also a way for remote team members to have as much influence as those in the Paris HQ, and to make decision making more transparent. 
<br><br>
                “Meetings are not transparent, because they force you to be in one point in time in one place. And it’s really hard to track decisions taken two years ago because they are not documented.” </h4>

        <div>
            <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Radical transparency</h2>
            <h4>In order for Alan’s kind of management structure to work, transparency is key, says Samuelian. 
<br>
                “We are very clear on who owns what — and when you decide on this level of empowerment, and you want people to be able to make decisions, they need information. 
    <br>            
                “That’s why we focus on radical transparency. We believe that it has a lot of advantages — people have all the information they need to make a decision, but it also forces you to explain what you do and to explain why. You are forced to articulate what you do.
        <br>        
                “I think it’s great as founders and the leadership team to have to explain why you make decisions. It forces you to be fair.” 
            <br>    
                One of the best examples of this is Alan’s transparent salaries. Everyone in the company can find out how much everyone else is paid and how much equity they have — and, the idea is, understand why. 
 <br>               
                Employees are graded based on a career framework, which takes into account how much impact they have on the company.
     <br>           
                “Management is not really valued at Alan — we think coaching and helping people grow is really important, but not everybody wants to be a manager. Some people want to be a really great individual contributor. People might have impact because they coach a lot of people, or they might have impact because they’re very central to strategy. There are a lot of different ways to be really impactful.” 
    <br>            
                If you can explain why someone is paid what they’re paid, this shouldn’t cause a problem, says Samuelian. Not being open about it could be more problematic: “People will know [each others’] salaries and equity, because this kind of information is always available somehow.” </h4>
